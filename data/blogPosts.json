    "body": "does over weight affect to your anticipated age ? The answer is yes, it does affect your anticipated age. The more you weigh over your ideal weight, the older you will look. This is because fat cells produce chemicals that cause inflammation. Inflammation ages the body, causing sagging skin and wrinkles. As you already know, being overweight can have a negative effect on your overall health. In addition to the increased risk of heart disease and diabetes, being overweight can also affect your body’s ability to fight off infection. If you are overweight, it can affect your anticipated age. Being overweight means that you have a higher body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of weight in relation to height. When you are overweight or obese, it can increase your risk of developing health problems such as heart disease, stroke and some cancers. Being overweight or obese also means that you’re likely to die younger than someone of the same age who has a healthy weight. There are numerous reasons for this; the most significant being that it is not healthy to be overweight. In addition, people who have been overweight for a long time will have more health issues than those who were never overweight."
